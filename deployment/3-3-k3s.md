# K3s
*[↑ Previous Article](./3-0-containerization.md)*

K3s is a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments and edge computing. Developed by Rancher Labs, K3s simplifies the Kubernetes experience by reducing the overall footprint while maintaining compatibility with Kubernetes APIs and tooling.

## Key Features of K3s

K3s is optimized for low-resource use cases, making it an excellent choice for IoT devices, edge computing, and development environments. Its key features include:

### 1. Lightweight Architecture
K3s is designed to be lightweight, with a binary size of less than 100 MB. This compact architecture enables it to run on resource-limited devices without sacrificing performance.

### 2. Simplified Installation
K3s offers a straightforward installation process, allowing users to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running with a single command. This ease of deployment makes it ideal for developers and teams looking to quickly spin up environments for testing or development.

### 3. Built-in Components
K3s includes several essential components out of the box, such as:
- **Containerd**: A lightweight container runtime that eliminates the need for Docker.
- **Flannel**: A simple network overlay that facilitates communication between containers across hosts.
- **Traefik**: A built-in ingress controller for managing external access to services.

### 4. Reduced Resource Consumption
K3s is designed to consume fewer resources than standard Kubernetes distributions, making it suitable for edge and IoT deployments. This reduction in overhead allows users to run clusters on devices with limited CPU and memory.

### 5. Automatic Updates
K3s can automatically manage its lifecycle, including updates and upgrades, simplifying cluster management for users.

### 6. K3s Agent
K3s includes a lightweight agent that can be deployed on multiple nodes, allowing for easy scaling of workloads across clusters. The agent runs as a daemon set and connects seamlessly to the K3s server.

## Use Cases for K3s

K3s is particularly well-suited for a variety of deployment scenarios:

### 1. Edge Computing
K3s can be deployed on edge devices, enabling applications to run closer to the end user. This reduces latency and improves performance for IoT applications.

### 2. Development and Testing
Developers can quickly set up K3s clusters for testing and development, making it easier to iterate on applications without the overhead of a full Kubernetes installation.

### 3. IoT Deployments
With its small footprint, K3s is ideal for IoT use cases, where resources are limited, and the ability to manage multiple devices is crucial.

### 4. CI/CD Pipelines
K3s can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, providing a lightweight environment for testing and deploying applications.

## How K3s Works

K3s retains the core components of Kubernetes while streamlining others to achieve its lightweight nature. Here’s how it works:

### Installation
To install K3s, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

### Architecture

K3s maintains the same architectural principles as Kubernetes. It uses a server-agent model, where the server manages the control plane and nodes run the agent to handle workloads.

### Networking

K3s uses Flannel for networking, ensuring that containers can communicate effectively across hosts. Additionally, it supports various networking plugins for enhanced capabilities.

## Comparison to Kubernetes

| Feature                    | K3s                                  | Kubernetes (K8s)                  |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Resource Footprint**     | Lightweight (< 100 MB)               | More resource-intensive            |
| **Installation**           | Simplified, single-command install    | More complex, manual setup        |
| **Built-in Components**     | Comes with Containerd, Flannel, Traefik | Modular, user-configured          |
| **Use Cases**              | Edge computing, IoT, development     | Large-scale, production environments |
| **Automatic Updates**       | Supports automatic updates            | Manual upgrades and maintenance    |
| **Networking**             | Primarily uses Flannel                | Flexible, requires setup          |


### Summary

K3s is a powerful and efficient alternative to traditional Kubernetes distributions, making it easier for developers and organizations to deploy and manage containerized applications in resource-constrained environments. With its lightweight architecture, simplified installation, and built-in components, K3s provides a seamless Kubernetes experience, particularly for edge computing, IoT, and development scenarios.

As containerized applications continue to gain popularity, K3s offers an excellent solution for teams looking to leverage Kubernetes without the complexity of a full-scale deployment.
